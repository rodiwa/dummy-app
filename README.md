## What does this repo do?
Trying out some CI/CD goodies.
This repo is to try out integration of Jenkins w Github Integrations

So every time I make a change and commit change, a webhook is fired on Jenkins that fires a simple build.

Note - Jenkins has been setup on a Google Cloud Compute Engine instance. Make sure the instance is running before you check this. To check - 34.72.104.210:8080
